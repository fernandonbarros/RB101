Original answer:
An error will be raised, since the variable greeting is never initialized. This 
is because the if statement is never executed.


Correct answer:
greeting will have value of nil. This happens because when a variable is initialized
inside an if block, the variable is automatically initialized to nil, even if the 
block is not executed.
